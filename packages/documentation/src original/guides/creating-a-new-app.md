# Creating a New App

This guide will help you create a new app with `react-md` along with
[create-react-app] as the project bootstrapper. The basic requirements for
continuing are:

- [node] installed with at least version `14` to make things simple
- [yarn] or [npm]
- experience in React

> If you want to get started immediately, you can view the
> [GitHub examples folder]({{GITHUB_URL}}/tree/main/examples) which outlines
> quick ways to spin up a new project with different build tools. Another
> alternative is using the
> [react-md GitHub template](https://github.com/mlaursen/template-rmd) to
> bootstrap a new repo with Next.js and some reasonable defaults.

## Bootstrapping a new Project

To get started, let's use `create-react-app` to bootstrap our new project:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Or with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn create react-app my-app
```

Once the command has completed, `cd` into the `my-app` directory and install
`react-md` and `sass`:

```sh
npm install --save react-md
npm install --save-dev sass
```

Or with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add react-md
yarn add --dev sass
```

Now that we've initialized our project, we can go ahead and start up the app
with the `start` command:

```sh
npm run start
```

Or with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn start
```

Once the app starts, you should see a page like this:

Great! Let's start adding some `react-md` into the mix. First, let's add the
general `Configuration` and `Layout` to our app. Start by editing the main
`src/index.js` to use the `Configuration` component:

```diff
 import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
+import { Configuration } from 'react-md';
 import './index.css';
 import App from './App';
 import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

 ReactDOM.render(
   <React.StrictMode>
-    <App />
+    <Configuration>
+      <App />
+    </Configuration>
   </React.StrictMode>,
   document.getElementById('root')
 );
```

Next, update the `src/App.js` to include the `Layout` component. Since the
`Layout` component is also used to render a navigation pane, we'll use the
`useLayoutNavigation` hook along with an empty navigation tree to handle that
behavior to start with.

```diff
+import { Layout, useLayoutNavigation } from 'react-md';
+
 import logo from './logo.svg';
 import './App.css';

+const navItems = {};
+
 function App() {
   return (
+    <Layout
+      title="react-md App"
+      navHeaderTitle="My App"
+      treeProps={useLayoutNavigation(navItems, window.location.pathname)}
+    >
       <div className="App">
         <header className="App-header">
           <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
           <p>
             Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
           </p>
           <a
             className="App-link"
             href="https://reactjs.org"
             target="_blank"
             rel="noopener noreferrer"
           >
             Learn React
           </a>
         </header>
       </div>
+    </Layout>
   );
 }
```

When you hit save, you'll be presented with this beauty:

![react-md without styles](/creating-a-new-app-2.png)

What?! That doesn't look anything close to how it was advertised! No problem.
Let's fix that by adding the base styles. Create a new file `src/App.scss` that
will import the `react-md` scss library as well as generate the default styles:

```scss
@use "react-md" as *;

@include react-md-utils;
```

Next, update `src/App.js` to import this file.

```diff
 import logo from './logo.svg';
 import { Layout, useLayoutNavigation } from 'react-md';
 import './App.css';
+import './App.scss';

 const navItems = {};
```

Once you save this file, you should now see an app with a decent looking layout
with the default color scheme.

> ![Missing sass error](/creating-a-new-app-sass-error.png) you can fix it by

We're getting close, but if you resize your browser, you'll notice something
weird in the layout:

![Missing Material Icons font](/creating-a-new-app-missing-icon-font.png)

Aha! We're missing the final part of including fonts! `react-md` defaults to
using the Roboto font along with the Material Icons font icon library. Luckily,
both of these can be quickly added to your site with [Google Fonts]. Let's
update the `public/index.html` one more time to add a `<link>` for the fonts:

```diff
     <!--
       manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
       user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/
     -->
     <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
+    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" />
+    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,500:700&display=swap" />
```

Once you save, you should now have both the material icons font and the Roboto
font available.

### :tada: Your first setup has been completed.

### Where do I go from here?

Well now that you've setup the basics for your first `react-md` styled app,
you'll probably be interested in:

- [Configuring your layout] - This will also go into more details about the
  navigation tree.
- [Customizing your theme] - The default colors, sizes, and fonts might not be
  your thing so this is all configurable.
- [Advanced Installation] - Using default styles from [unpkg.com] to speed up
  initial compilation and optionally using the UMD bundle.
- viewing the different packages within `react-md` and seeing the components
  they provide.
