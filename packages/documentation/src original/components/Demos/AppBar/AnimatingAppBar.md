It is also possible to animate and change the height of the toolbar using the
`rmd-app-bar-theme` mixins or custom CSS variables. The example below will show
how you can animate the app bar when the user scrolls from a custom height to
the default app bar height.

This example also shows how you can use a background image with an app bar.

Note: this is a pretty bad implementation and doesn't work across all browsers.
