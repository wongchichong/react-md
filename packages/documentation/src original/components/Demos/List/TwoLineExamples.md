The `ListItem` also supports adding a second line of supplementary text using
the `secondaryText` prop. The secondary text will be placed below the primary
text within the item and gain the secondary text color to show some contrast.
All the normal left and right addons can be used as well. Just like the primary
text within a list item, the secondary text will be truncated once it reaches
the overflow point.
