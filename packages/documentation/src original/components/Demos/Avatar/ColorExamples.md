The `Avatar` component has a few pre-made colors available by default. You can
change the color by supplying the `color` prop.

This example also shows how you can use one of the special exports from each
package to get the some variable names from SCSS in js using the `scssVariables`
from the `dist` folder.

> If you are using `Typescript`, the `scssVariables` file will be fully typed as
> well! So you won't have to worry about guessing what variable is what and
> it'll error if you try to use an invalid value.
