This example is a bit more complex than the previous and showcases:

- adding additional validation around what types of files can be uploaded
- enabling drag and drop uploads with `useDropzone`
- uploading files to a server using
  [XHLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
- using the returned value from the hook to display additional information to
  the user

> Note: The server upload portion will not work once converted imported into a
> code sandbox.
