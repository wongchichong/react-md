This package also exports an extremely simple `Form` component that just
prevents default behavior when it is submitted. This is super nice since the
majority of the time you'll want to use ajax on form submit instead of the
default behavior. Check out the example below for an extended usage of the
`Form` component and some of the other components together to make a "New
Contact" form.
