Text fields are a wrapper for the `<input type="text" />` with some general
themes and styles applied. There are four different themes available by default:

- `"unstyled"` - removes all the default borders, background colors, etc.
- `"underline"` - adds an underline to the text field that animates in when the
  input gains focus as well as including a floating label
- `"filled"` - an extension of the `"underline"` theme that also adds a
  background color to it
- `"outline"` - adds a outline to the text field and animates a floating label
  with it.
