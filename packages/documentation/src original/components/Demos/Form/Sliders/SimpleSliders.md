A `Slider` is a component that allows the user to select a number value from a
specific range of numbers. This component is fully controlled and requires the
use of the `useSlider` hook to provide the `value` and "controls" to updating
the `value`. The hook allows for customizing the `min`, `max`, and `step`
options.

The `Slider` also requires a `baseId` and either a `label`, an `aria-label`, or
an `aria-labelledby` for accessibility.

Check out the examples below to see how to use the `useSlider` hook and a few of
the styling props available for the `Slider`.
