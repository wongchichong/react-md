A `Table` within `react-md` will have some defaulted styles to match the
material design specifications. The default styles are:

- the table's width is determined by the content size
- align each cell in the table to be centered vertically and left horizontally
- apply `border-bottom` to each `<tr>` in the `<tbody>`
- apply a hover `background-color` to each `<tr>` in the `<tbody>`
- disable line wrapping and apply ellipsis for long text (requires setting a
  `width` to each cell though)
