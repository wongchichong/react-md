Since it might not be desired to have the same material design theme for your
app, it is possible to update the base button theme by updating the different
button SCSS variables before importing and including the button styles. If you
have not done so, please read the pretty good write up in the
[theme documentation](/packages/theme#custom-theme) for all the detailed theming
information. It's also recommended to read the
[states documentation](/packages/states) to read about disable the ripple effect
or custom interaction states as well.
