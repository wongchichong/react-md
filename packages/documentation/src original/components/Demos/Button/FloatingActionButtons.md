Buttons can also be rendered as a
[floating action button](https://material.io/components/buttons-floating-action-button)
(FAB) by setting the `floating` prop to a position to render within the
viewport. The default available positions are:

- `"top-left"`
- `"top-right"`
- `"bottom-left"`
- `"bottom-right"`

Even though this example will show within a phone on larger screen sizes, these
type of buttons do not need to be mobile only.
