Text buttons are generally used when an action is less important or should not
be the user's main focus. This is the default button theme type and allows you
to create a button with no additional props (other than `children`):

```tsx
<Button>Button</Button>
```

These types of buttons are normally placed with the #dialog or #card packages
and components.
