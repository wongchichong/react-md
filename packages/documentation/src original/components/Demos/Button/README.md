A button will default to a `"clear"` theme so that it can be used easily with no
additional props, but there are 5 total theme colors provided by default:

- `"primary"` - the **theme** primary color
- `"secondary"` - the **theme** secondary color
- `"warning"` - the **theme** warning color
- `"error"` - the **theme** error color
- `"clear"` - the current **typography** primary text color
- `disabled` - disabled styles when the button is disabled (not using the
  `theme` prop)

These themes will either be applied to the text, border, or background colors
depending on the theme type. The available theme types are:

- `"flat"` - the button will be flat with the background.
- `"outline"` - the button with have a border
- `"contained"` - the button with be slightly elevated and have different
  background colors.

Check out the couple of examples below for the different button theme types
available.
