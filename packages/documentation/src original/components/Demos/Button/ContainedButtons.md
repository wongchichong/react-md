Contained buttons have high emphasis as they have an entire color fill and
shadow. Contained buttons can be created by setting the `themeType="contained"`
prop.

Note that the `clear` prop still works for a contained button but looks
extremely out of place most of the time since it just gains the `surface` theme
background color. It is generally recommended to not use the `clear` theme for
contained buttons or add a custom theme override for it instead.
