This package is used for setting up your general layout as well as some
convenience wrappers for initializing all the required context providers within
`react-md`.

It is highly recommended to also check out the
[Configuring Your Layout](/guides/configuring-your-layout) guide for a more
in-depth example along with updating your layout to include a navigation tree
and a routing library.
