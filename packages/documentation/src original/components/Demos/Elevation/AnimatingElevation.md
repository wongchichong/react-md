This package also exports an additional mixins that might be useful:

- `rmd-elevation-transition`

The `rmd-elevation-transition` mixin is just a wrapper for the
`rmd-transition-shadow-transition` mixin that only works with different
elevations. You'll primarily want to use this mixin unless you want to merge box
shadow values together.
