One of the downsides to the `CrossFade` component is that the transition is
triggered once the component mounts which means the only way to trigger new
animations is by changing the `key` for this component. Since it isn't always
ideal to have to re-mount the child component to trigger the transition, this
package also exports a `useCrossFadeTransition` hook to implement this
transition.

The `useCrossFadeTransition` hook is really a hook version of the `CrossFade`
component that allows a bit more control for when the transition should fire
since it uses the [useCSSTransition hook](#use-css-transition) behind the
scenes. To create a transition, all that's required is to trigger the `'enter'`
transition when it should be fired. Unlike the `CrossFade` component, the
`useCrossFadeTransition` hook **does not automatically fire on mount**.

Since it's a bit hard to demo router changes that can be pushed to sandboxes,
the demo below will show an example of using this pattern with the #tabs
package. However, you can view the
[configuring your layout guide](/guides/configuring-your-layout#adding-route-transitions-optional)
for the `react-router` example.
