This package also exports a pretty awesome hook: `useFixedPositioning` that ties
in directly with the `useCSSTransition`/`CSSTransition` API so that you can
position a fixed element to another element within the page ensuring that it can
fit within the viewport. Some great existing examples of this component are the
#menu and #tooltip packages since they use this hook behind the scenes position
themselves automatically.

> If you used `react-md@v1`, this is basically a new and improved version of the
> `Layover` component.
