Tooltips will automatically have a max-width applied to them of `15rem` by
default. This value can always be updated by changing the
`$rmd-tooltip-max-width` value or using the `rmd-tooltip-update-var` mixin.

This example will show how tooltips will automatically line-wrap if there is too
much content. This is also a good example on mobile for how to handle tooltips
that can't be positioned fully in the viewport above or below the container
element.
