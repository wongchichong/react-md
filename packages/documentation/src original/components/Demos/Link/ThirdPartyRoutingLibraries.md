You can also render the `Link` component using a third-party link/routing
library. Popular examples are:

- [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [@reach/router](https://github.com/reach/router)
- [next.js][1]

Since this documentation site is using [next.js][1], I won't have a live example
here for using `react-router`, but you can view the source code or open the code
sandbox link to see how other libraries can work with it.

If you are using `react-router`, you can use the `component` prop to render as
the `Link` from `react-router` and provide all the `react-router` link specific
props into the react-md `Link`:

```tsx
import { ReactElement } from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import { Link as ReactRouterLink, LinkProps } from "react-router-dom";
import { Link as ReactMDLink } from "@react-md/link";

function Link(props: LinkProps): ReactElement {
  return <ReactMDLink component={ReactRouterLink} {...props} />;
}

function App(): ReactElement {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link to="/login">Login</Link>
    </div>
  );
}

render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```
