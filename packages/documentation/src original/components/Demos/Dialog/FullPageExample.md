A full page dialog is really just as it seems: a dialog that covers the entire
page. These sorts of dialogs are good to use when you want to display a lot of
information temporarily but don't need to transition to a different page. Some
good examples of this are:

- full screen previews for images or videos
- large temporary forms
- editing lots of data within a table

The example below will open a full screen preview of the image when it has been
clicked.
