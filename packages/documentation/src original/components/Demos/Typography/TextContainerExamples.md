The `TextContainer` is a simple component that can be used to center and apply a
`max-width` to children content (normally text). The line width can be
configured with the [$rmd-typography-mobile-max-line-length],
[$rmd-typography-desktop-max-line-width],
[$rmd-typography-text-container-breakpoint] SCSS variables.
