A chip can also be used as a radio group which is named a choice chip from the
material design guidelines. These sorts of chips are great if you want to create
a more condensed version of a radio group to display all choices to the user.

To create a choice chip, you'll provide a `selected` prop just like for the
filter chips but also enable an `selectedThemed` prop which will update the
selected state to use a swatch of the primary theme color.
