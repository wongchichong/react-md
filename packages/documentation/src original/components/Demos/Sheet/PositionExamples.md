A `Sheet` is an extension of the `Dialog` component that allows you to create
temporary elements at the edges of the viewport instead of centered within the
page. Fixing a sheet to the `left` or `right` sides of the page is useful for
creating permanent or temporary content such as navigation trees, additional
configuration, or filters. The `left` and `right` behavior will automatically be
updated when the language is set to `dir="rtl"` for you as well.

The `Sheet` also supports being fixed to the `top` and `bottom` of the viewport,
but this is more of a mobile feature that can be used to create action sheets.
