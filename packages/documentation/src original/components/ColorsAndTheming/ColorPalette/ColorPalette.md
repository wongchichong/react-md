## Color Palette

Material design provides a default color palette that has 256 colors for you to
pick and choose from, but you are not required to use this color palette. This
number might seem overwhelming at first, but you will never need all the colors
at once and will primarily only use 3 to 6 colors.

#### I recommend reading over [the color system](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html) from the main material design site for full understanding of the colors and how to choose colors.

`react-md` will expose all the colors as Sass variables as well as in the
`@react-md/theme/dist/scssVariables` export if you'd like access to them in
javascript. Each of the primary colors above will include 10 different shades
which all have different suffixes. All the colors other than brown, grey, and
blue grey will also include 4 "accent" color shades that can be used for your
app's secondary theme color. You can see all the colors listed below.
